* `Read Messages`
  * To read commands given to the bot in a chat channel.
* `Send Messages`
  * To send basic responses to given commands and to edit the bot's own messages.
* `Embed Links`
  * To show pretty embedded messages, this is used in `/price` and `/item`.
* `Attach Files`
  * To attach images to messages, the `/history` command uses this to attach a graph.
